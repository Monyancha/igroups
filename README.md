A Twilio powered VBX virtual phone system with multi-tenant and payment support (via Stripe).
A complete competitive analysis of this platform was done (check out vbx_business_case.pdf) and provides some useful points, such as market research, price point suggestions, feature subset recommendations to maximize profit, etc.
Screenshots are located in the vbx_screenshots.pdf file.

Make sure that you update the config/database.php with your credentials.

Based on the wonderful OpenVBX (http://www.openvbx.org/) project.

You may use it for personal and commercial purposes, just give me credit when you are. Or not.
But if you have ideas and improvement suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
